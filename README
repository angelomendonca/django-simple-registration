Version 0.1  Use at own risk.

How to install.

1.  Copy simple_registration to project.  My-Project/simple_registration.

2.  Copy templates to your site templates directory.  NB auth templates WILL NOT LOAD from where they are simple_registration/templates/registration/ even if you have the app template loader installed.

3.  Add (r'^accounts/', include('simple_registration.urls')), to base urls file.  NB do not add a namespace to this include, auth url reverse features break if you attempt to namespace them.
